/**
 * 2.	Implement a subway journey tracker that stores travel time between stations # and it's able to calculate average time between any 2 given stations.
 *
 * startTrip("U00001", "TSQ", "0802")
 * startTrip("U00002", "TSQ", "0816")
 * endTrip("U00001", "WALLST", "0824")
 * startTrip("U00003", "TSQ", "0828")
 * endTrip("U00002", "WALLST", "0841")
 * endTrip("U00003", "WALLST", "0855")
 *
 * Notes â€“ startTrip and endTrip contains a unique train identifier, the station tag, and the time the train arrives at the station.
 *
 * Solution should account for things such as: (Edge cases)
 * -	Two trains leaving at the same time from the same station
 * -	A train leaving but not having an end trip (train broke down and never reached)
 *
 * Sample input: print('Average travel time between Time Square and Wall Street is: ' + avgTime("TSQ", "WALLST"))
